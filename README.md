## 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates **hands-on CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions**, focusing on **continuous integration best practices** for Python projects.

It showcases how to:
- Automate builds and tests on every push
- Use YAML-based workflows
- Enforce code quality using CI pipelines
- Integrate testing into development workflows

CI/CD is a **core DevOps and MLOps skill**, and this repository highlights my ability to build **reliable, automated pipelines**.

# 🧪 CI/CD Components 

---

## 1️⃣ Introductory GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/hello.yml`

### What It Does
- Demonstrates the structure of a GitHub Actions workflow
- Triggers on repository events
- Executes basic steps

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Workflow syntax
- Jobs and steps
- Event-based automation

---

## 2️⃣ Python Continuous Integration Pipeline

**File:** `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`

### What It Does
- Runs on every push and pull request
- Sets up a Python environment
- Installs dependencies
- Executes automated tests

### Concepts Demonstrated
- CI pipelines
- Dependency installation
- Automated testing
- Fail-fast feedback

 
“How do you set up CI for a Python project?”

---

## 3️⃣ Automated Testing

**File:** `tests/test_sample.py`

### What It Does
- Defines unit tests for the project
- Validates code behavior during CI runs

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Test-driven development foundations
- Quality gates in CI/CD
- Preventing regressions

---

## 4️⃣ Dependency Management

**File:** `requirements.txt`

### Purpose
- Ensures consistent environments across CI runs
- Enables reproducible builds

---

## 🧠 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

This repository complements my work in:
- Docker & containerized applications
- FastAPI ML microservices
- Kubernetes deployments
- MLOps pipelines (MLflow, DVC)
- Cloud-native development workflows

It shows I can **automate quality checks**, not just write code.

---

## ⚙️ How the CI Pipeline Works

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. GitHub Actions triggers workflows  
3. Python environment is provisioned  
4. Dependencies are installed  
5. Tests are executed automatically  
6. Pipeline passes or fails with feedback  

---

## 🧾  Points 

- Built **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions** to automate testing and validation for Python projects.  
- Authored **YAML-based workflows** to trigger builds and tests on every push and pull request.  
- Integrated **automated unit tests** into CI pipelines to enforce code quality and prevent regressions.  
- Applied DevOps best practices for **continuous integration, automation, and reproducible builds**.

---

## 🧠 I Points

- “CI/CD ensures issues are caught early.”
- “I use GitHub Actions to automate testing on every change.”
- “YAML workflows are central to modern DevOps.”
